## What is AutoDJ?

You play one song. AutoDJ figures out the rest.

It discovers similar tracks via Last.fm and Spotify, finds them on YouTube/Invidious/Piped/DAB/HiFi, downloads each track to a local cache, analyzes it for the best fade point, and crossfades between two virtual decks — automatically, continuously, without you touching anything. Drop it on a second screen, point it at a TV, and walk away.

**Persistent playback:** Close the DJ console tab — the Now Playing display keeps playing. The server auto-advances the queue independently.

Two pages:

| Page | URL | Who it's for |
|------|-----|--------------|
| **DJ Console** | `/dj` | You — full mixer, decks, queue control, settings |
| **Now Playing** | `/display` | Everyone else — big beautiful now-playing screen with relay audio |

---

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up -d
open http://localhost:3000/dj
```

### Node.js (no Docker)

```bash
node --version  # must be v22+
npm install
node server.js
# Open http://localhost:3000/dj
```

No database. No build step. First-time setup: open Settings, add a Last.fm API key (free), set a seed artist on the Discover tab, and play.

---

## Features

### 🎛️ DJ Console
Two virtual decks with real-time waveform, BPM display, VU meters, cue points, and a crossfader. Live deck glows red. Smart Fade Analysis scans the waveform to find the quietest fade point before each transition.

### 📋 Queue Engine
Drag-to-reorder queue with source badges. Queue persists across page reloads. Unified search lets you search all music sources at once. Queue limit setting caps total tracks.

### 🔍 Music Sources
Six lanes tried in priority order: **Invidious** → **Piped** → **DAB** → **Jamendo** (optional) → **HiFi** → **MeTube** (sidecar). YouTube -Topic channels filtered by default (toggle in Settings). All downloads cached locally so stream URLs never expire mid-track.

### 🧠 Discovery
- **Last.fm** (free) — similar artists, genre-tagged recommendations
- **Spotify** (free credentials) — artist top tracks, recommendations seeded from any track
- **AI** (optional Claude/GPT/OpenCode) — describe a mood in plain English

### 📺 Now Playing Display
Full-screen display with large artwork, track info, animated orbs, lyrics (synced LRC), mega progress bar with fade zone marker, next-up preview, live clock, marquee (RSS headlines + custom messages), and side visualizer bars.

### 🔊 Persistent Playback
The display page acts as a dedicated audio player. Close the DJ console — audio keeps going. The server runs an auto-advance engine: `advanceTrack()`, `preCacheNextTrack()`, playback timer. SSE broadcasts `play`/`stop` commands. Queue and track index persist to disk.

### 🎨 Spotify-Inspired UI
Green accent palette (`#1db954`). Light/dark mode with system preference detection and manual toggle (saved to localStorage). Smooth CSS transitions between themes. Responsive layout for mobile.

### ⏱️ Session Controls
Set a session duration (hours) and queue limit (tracks) in Settings. Mix tab shows live indicators: remaining session time and queue count/limit. Session auto-stops when time expires.

### 📱 PWA Ready
Installable as a standalone app. Manifest, service worker with app shell caching, icons, and PWA meta tags on both pages.

### 📊 System Stats
Live stat cards on the Mix tab: CPU, RAM, Disk, Temp Storage, Session, Queue — polled every 3 seconds.

### 👥 Listener Tracking
**Listeners tab** shows every device connected to the Now Playing display: IP, browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge), OS (Windows/macOS/Linux/Android/iOS), device type (mobile/tablet/desktop), page, and connection duration. Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds.

## First-Time Setup

1. Open `http://localhost:3000/dj`
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Add a **Last.fm API key** (free at [last.fm/api](https://www.last.fm/api)) — enables Discovery
4. Optionally add **Spotify**, **Jamendo**, **Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenCode** keys
5. Click **Save Settings**
6. Go to **Discover** tab, enter a seed artist, click **Start Discovery**
7. Go to **Mix** tab and press ▶

## Tips

- **Put `/display` on a second screen** in fullscreen (`F11`). Updates live over SSE.
- **Persistent playback:** Open the display page, enable audio, then close the DJ tab. The display keeps playing.
- **Name files `Artist - Title.mp3`** for automatic metadata parsing.
- **Smart Fade** works best on tracks with natural outros. Set crossfade to 2-3s for hard cuts.
- **Temp uploads** are ephemeral — auto-deleted when queue clears.
- **Theme toggle** in the topbar — cycles light/dark. Respects system preference by default.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing plays / searches fail** — Invidious/Piped instances may be down. Try a different network or VPN. Check Settings → Test Sources.

**Display shows "Enable Audio" but no sound** — Browser requires a user gesture. Click the button. Audio must be re-enabled after page refresh.

**Docker build errors** — Run `docker compose build --no-cache` to clear stale layers.

**No audio from local files** — Click ▶ on deck A once to unlock browser autoplay.
